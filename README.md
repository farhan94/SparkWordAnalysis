## Working with Docker from the command line once installed

With Docker one can build containers by using Docker's library of open source Dockerfiles. Examples one can use from Docker Hub are Ubuntu, Hadoop, and MySQl. However, one can build their own container by writing their own Dockerfile. Docker uses a Dockerfile to build images (what are needed to run a container). A Dockerfile is just text document that contains commands Docker will use to build an image for a container. There are four commands we used to build our Docker container image.

### FROM

### COPY

### RUN

### CMD

There are only a few Docker commands one needs to be familiar with to use their first Docker container.

### docker build

### docker run

### docker exec

### docker start

### docker stop

Example for creating your first docker container.
